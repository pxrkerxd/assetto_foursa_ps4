## 🔥 Core Features (Implemented)

### 📊 Real-Time Intelligence Dashboard
- **Live WebSockets Sync:** Dashboard updates instantly as new reviews hit the database without requiring page refreshes.
- **Dynamic AI Executive Verdict:** A generative logic engine that reads aggregated stats and writes a human-readable performance summary instantly.
- **Multi-Branch Leaderboard:** Ranks different business locations (e.g., Navi Mumbai, Nerul) against each other based on AI sentiment scores.
- **NLP Tag Cloud:** Extracts and visualizes key themes (#Taste, #Service, #WaitTime) to track specific operational metrics.

### 🛡️ Security & Executive Access
- **Gatekeeper Admin Access:** Secure, role-based login screen protecting the intelligence hub.
- **One-Click Executive Export:** Bypasses the dark-mode UI to generate a clean, boardroom-ready PDF report of the dashboard for upper management.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Flags suspicious, spam, or drastically low-rated reviews.
